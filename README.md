# Pokemon Clicky Game
A dynamic web based game to test your memory. Written using React.js.

### How to Play:
- Each time you click on a picture of a pokemon, a point will be added to your score.
- However, a unique Pokemon must be selected each time. If any Pokemon is clicked more than once in a single round, the score is reset and the round is lost.
- There are 300 different Pokemon in this game! Do you think you can catch 'em all?
